# ROS and ArduPilot Integration

**ROS_and_Ardupilot** provides a framework for integrating **Robot Operating System (ROS/ROS 2)** with **ArduPilot** using a standard `catkin_ws` workspace structure.  
This repository enables seamless communication between ROS nodes and ArduPilot-controlled vehicles, ideally suited for simulation (SITL), SLAM, and real-world robotics development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   **ROS Noetic** (ROS 1) or your preferred ROS distribution installed
-   **ArduPilot** source or binaries available
-   **Catkin build tools** (`catkin_make` or `catkin build`)
-   Dependencies: `MAVROS`, `GeographicLib`, DDS (for ROS2), and SLAM libraries if required

---

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/FireFistisDead/ROS_and_Ardupilot.git](https://github.com/FireFistisDead/ROS_and_Ardupilot.git)
    cd ROS_and_Ardupilot
    ```

2.  **Set up your ROS workspace**
    ```bash
    cd catkin_ws
    mkdir -p src
    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.bash
    ```

3.  **Integrate ArduPilot**
    -   Place or clone the Arducopter source code into the `Arducopter/` directory.
    -   Ensure dependencies (e.g., MAVROS, microDDS, SLAM libraries) are installed.

4.  **Build and Launch**
    ```bash
    cd ~/ROS_and_Ardupilot/catkin_ws
    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.bash
    ```
    Launch your desired configuration‚Äîbe it SITL simulation or real hardware‚Äîleveraging ROS and ArduPilot interplay.

## üîß Features & Use Cases

| Feature                     | Description                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simulation** | Use SITL to simulate ArduPilot behavior inside ROS workflows.                                           |
| **ROS ‚Üî ArduPilot Comm** | Send commands to vehicles and receive telemetry via ROS nodes (e.g., using MAVROS or DDS).              |
| **SLAM & Navigation** | Integrate SLAM packages (Cartographer, Hector, RTAB-Map, etc.) with ArduPilot for GPS-denied navigation. |
| **Hardware Readiness** | Supports deployment with Pixhawk/Cube and companion computers via ROS.                                  |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Suggested Workflow Example

A typical ROS ‚Üí ArduPilot simulation loop might involve:

1.  Starting ROS and sourcing the workspace
2.  Launching SITL using ArduPilot binaries/scripts within `Arducopter/`
3.  Running MAVROS or DDS nodes to bridge topics and vehicle telemetry
4.  Initiating SLAM or navigation packages to send movement commands
5.  Observing behavior in RViz, Gazebo, or real hardware
